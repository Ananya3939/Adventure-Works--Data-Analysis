# Adventure-Works--Data-Analysis
The Adventure Works project used Tableau, Power BI, Excel, and SQL to analyze key performance indicators. SQL extracted data, Excel cleaned it, and Tableau and Power BI visualized metrics like sales, customer behavior, and financials. The outcome was insightful dashboards and reports for strategic decision-making.
